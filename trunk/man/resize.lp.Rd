\title{Resize LP}

\description{
Resize the data structures in an lpSolve linear programming model.
}

\usage{
resize.lp(lprec, nrow, ncol)
}

\arguments{
  \item{lprec}{an lpSolve linear programming model.}
  \item{nrow}{a single nonnegative integer value specifying the new number of rows for the lpSolve linear programming model.}
  \item{ncol}{a single nonnegative integer value specifying the new number of rows for the lpSolve linear programming model.}
}

\details{
If the new size of the model is smaller than the size of the current model, the excess rows and/or columns are deleted. If the new size is larger, no change will be immediately apparent. However, the internal structures of \code{lprec} will have been adjusted to accommodate the larger model. Efficiency of model building can be improved by calling this function before adding additional columns (for example).
}

\value{
a logical value indicating whether the model was successfully resized is invisibly returned.
}
